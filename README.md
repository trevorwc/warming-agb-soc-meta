This code accompanies the paper ______ by Cambron et al.

In this paper, we perform a random effects meta-analysis of the response to experimental warming of aboveground biomass, soil carbon, and the combination of the two. We also model responses using a metaforest, and upscale these results using global gridded datasets. 

The file 0.00Cleaning does some basic data cleaning, after which the dataset was supplemented as necessary.

The file 0.01Cleaning combines ancillary variables with the cleaned dataset, producing a final dataset which will be used in the analysis

The file 1.0Analysis contains the code necessary to conduct the random effects meta-analysis as well as train the metaforest model, which is exported for later upscaling. 

The file 2.0Upscaling metaforest takes as input several gridded datasets and predicts the global change in AGB under warming.
